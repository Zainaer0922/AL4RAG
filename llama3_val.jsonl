{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Jon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. \"It's been a really rough day,\" Susan Reiter told CNN. \"Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive.\" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. \"Huge disaster,\" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. \"Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap.\" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that \"a huge avalanche swept over basecamp\" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. \"On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,\" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. \"This also makes it more difficult to search for people.\" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. \"The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,\" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. \"Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal.\" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an \"adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer.\" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. \"We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,\" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,\" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, \"whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation.\" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. \"On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,\" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, \"which is very dangerous anyway,\" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, \"the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves.\" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. \"It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,\" he said. \"I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. \"It's been a bad few years on Everest,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength.\" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, \"Into Thin Air.\" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. \"This is our job,\" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost \"friends in brothers\" in the 2014 avalanche. \"So there is always a risk of death.\" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of \"The Seven Summits\" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 \"because it didn't feel right\" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? \"You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,\" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. \"But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back.\" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors. CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.\n", "chosen": "A massive earthquake struck Nepal, causing avalanches on Mount Everest that resulted in numerous fatalities.

Despite the tragedy, many mountaineers plan to return to the mountain. Jon Reiter's wife, Susan, believes he will attempt to climb Everest again, despite the risks.

They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.\n", "chosen": "World War I soldiers wrote their names and messages in a French chalk quarry, which was discovered recently.

The conflict is exacting a heavy toll on children and families, UNICEF said in a statement. \"The humanitarian situation is worsening all the time, with increasingly limited access to water, basic sanitation and critical health services,\" the statement quoted UNICEF Yemen representative Julien Harneis, speaking from Amman, Jordan, as saying. \"The supplies we have managed to bring in today can make the difference between life and death for children and their families -- but we know they are not enough, and we are planning more of these airlifts.\" Aid agencies have been saying that supplies were desperately needed, but getting them into the country in the midst of regional turmoil was difficult. UNICEF said its cargo included antibiotics, bandages, syringes, IV sets and other medical supplies. Included as well, the agency said, were micronutrients for up to 20,000 children and water storage materials airlifted through Djibouti from UNICEF's supply center in Denmark. Also Friday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said that about 900 refugees from Yemen have arrived in the Horn of Africa. Many more are reportedly trying to make the trip but are hampered by fuel shortages and high fees by boat operators. \"UNHCR is extremely concerned about the dangers for anyone trying to flee across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, where there are no search and rescue operations,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Last year, 246 lives were reported lost in sea crossings to Yemen. UNHCR appeals to all ships in the area to be extra vigilant and assist any boats in distress. We also ask that countries with vessels in waters near Yemen -- including surveillance and anti-piracy vessels -- instruct their ships to help with rescues.\" It said that, as demand increases, the boats attempting the dangerous crossing are likely to become more crowded -- a crossing that has historically been made in the other direction, by people fleeing Africa in favor of Yemen. Many Yemenis are attempting the trip in rickety fishing boats. One family told CNN the crossing was \"a window into hell.\" And underscoring the increasing toll being exacted by the conflict in Yemen, the World Health Organization said Friday that at least 643 people have been killed in the country since the fighting escalated three weeks ago. But it acknowledged that the number was almost certainly an underestimate. \"As of 6 April 2015 there have been a total of 643 deaths and 2,226 injuries,\" the WHO, the health arm of the United Nations, said in a statement. \"Casualty estimates are likely to change in the coming days as additional cases are verified and reported.\" The figures cover the period from March 19 to April 6. They include, however, only deaths and injuries verified by a health facility. Other deaths and injuries have undoubtedly occurred. Security in the country, which is on the Arabian Peninsula, deteriorated sharply last month when Houthi rebels advanced on Sanaa and the port city of Aden, forcing President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to flee the country. Since then, Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes meant to halt the advance of the Houthis.

However, aid agencies acknowledge that more supplies are urgently needed. Meanwhile, the UNHCR reports that around 900 refugees from Yemen have arrived in the Horn of Africa, while many more are attempting the perilous journey across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. At least 643 people have been killed in the conflict since March 19, although this figure is likely an underestimate. The World Health Organization notes that security in the country has deteriorated sharply, leading to a worsening humanitarian crisis.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has backed out of next month's visit to Moscow for World War II anniversary celebrations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. \"We were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels,\" Peskov said. \"The decision is connected with North Korean domestic affairs.\" The visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. He was to have met with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit to coincide with Victory Day, marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments, including the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Germany, Vietnam and Venezuela. This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations. Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation. There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west. Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program. And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year. CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing.  And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear. That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world. And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge. According to Shin, intelligence officials say the North Korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own.

Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified \"treatment,\" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday \"lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,\" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. \"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,\" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. \"This kid's obviously a fighter,\" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. \"It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that.\" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. \"The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,\" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. \"She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,\" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore \"clear criminal liability in this case.\" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Los Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table:. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.\n", "chosen": "California's drought affects the entire US due to its role as a major agricultural producer. The drought has led to increased prices for certain grocery items such as berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, packaged salad, and peppers. Economists predict that fruit and vegetable prices will continue to rise this year due to inflation, while the strength of the US dollar and lower oil prices may mitigate the impact. The drought also affects other states, including Texas and Oklahoma, which have seen extreme and exceptional drought conditions. As a result, consumers have paid more for beef and veal, with prices expected to rise further. The drought has also led to changes in tourist habits, with restaurants serving water only upon request and hotels requiring guests to request laundry services. However, the drought has had a positive effect on California's wine industry, leading to a record-breaking harvest and higher-quality wines.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a \"serial litigant,\" who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. McCready's complaint claimed that Key had breached a section of the country's Human Rights Act relating to sexual harassment, TVNZ reported. It reported that he was seeking considerable compensation for the waitress, 26-year-old Amanda Bailey, and \"if she does not want it I ask for the money be given to Women's Refuge.\" Key publicly apologized to Bailey, a waitress at his local cafe, for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail, after she complained about his behavior in a blog post. The post, published on New Zealand political website The Daily Blog, says that the odd behavior began during last year's election season. It was \"hardly an acceptable form of greeting,\" Bailey wrote. She wrote that while she didn't directly make her objections clear verbally, her body language \"screamed 'I don't like that.'\" \"As he approached me, he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary, suspense sound effects, like the music from the movie 'Jaws',\" read the post. \"As he towered overhead I slunk down, cringing, whilst (Key's wife) Bronagh told him to 'Leave the poor girl alone.'\" The behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions, the post states. Eventually the cafe's manager made it clear to Key that his actions were unwelcome. Key, who regularly visits the Auckland cafe with his wife, told reporters that his behavior was in the context of \"a bit of banter,\" but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense. The blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own JK 2012 Pinot Noir wine by way of apology. \"We have lots of fun and games there, there's always lots of practical jokes and things. It's a very warm and friendly relationship,\" he told reporters in Los Angeles en route to ANZAC day commemorations in Gallipoli, Turkey. \"But if you look at it now, no. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry.\" Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. \"A lot of New Zealanders know what it's like to feel as if you're not taken seriously in a job. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied,\" New Zealand media reported her as saying. \"It's a sign of how out of touch John Key has become when he can't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is, and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving.\" Jackie Blue, head of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, echoed the sentiment. \"It's never OK to touch someone without their permission,\" TVNZ reported her as saying. \"There are no exceptions.\" Political analyst Bryce Edwards told the network that the \"strangeness factor\" of the accusation would haunt Key. \"A lot of people will be laughing at John Key, that's harder to recover from,\" he said in a segment. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier. \"The fact that our Prime Minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture. And it starts at the top,\" the organization's chief executive Sue McCabe wrote in an open letter. \"Up and down this country, day after day, people are touched without giving their consent.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Phoenix, Arizona (CNN)Nearly 12 million parents in the United States currently are raising kids on their own. When single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer, everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle. Jody Farley-Berens saw the need firsthand, when her childhood friend faced that situation. \"Making ends meet is insurmountable,\" said Farley-Berens. \"There are so many doctors' appointments, copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  And then the inability to work -- any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly.\" She did all she could to help.  After her friend passed away, Farley-Berens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances. Since 2006, Singleton Moms has provided practical, financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the Phoenix area. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015. Tiffany Montgomery, 48, was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer. Farley-Berens' group pitched in to help, so Montgomery could spend more time with her daughter Ezri, now 10. \"When you can't really do much and you're looking at the dirt on the floor, it's one more level of stress,\" she said.  \"You have these people that come in, that don't know you, and 'You're going to help me with cleaning my house?'\" \"Singleton Moms has actually changed my whole outlook. They care about you, and they're demonstrating their love through their actions.\" I sat down with Farley-Berens to ask her about her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: Tell me about the woman who inspired your work. Farley-Berens:  I grew up with a girl named Michelle Singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30.  She was a single mother of four children and I was a young mom with two kids. And it was scary. You just want to be there to watch them grow up. Paying the bills, cleaning her home, making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle. I wanted to make things as easy as possible for her. So when I would go to the store, I'd grab an extra Tide and extra toilet paper. When I would make my meals for my family, I would double it and bring a meal over to her house.  Once I helped with an electric bill.  I just tried to do those little things that I hoped would relieve her of some stress. About six months after she passed, we got to thinking she couldn't have been the only one. There were other people like her that needed help.  And that's how Singleton Moms was born. CNN: I'd imagine that many people haven't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer.  How are you able to help? Farley-Berens: We focus on day-to-day support -- financial assistance, housecleaning, prepared meals, supplies for the home, kids' events. It's that old-fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors. Who doesn't like a clean house that they didn't have to clean themselves? We have a team of volunteers that have all been background-checked and they sweep, mop, clean the bathrooms. We even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes. And so, our parents can come home from chemo, sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about, \"Ugh, the bathroom needs to be cleaned.\"  It's just to allow them to focus on what's important, which is their health and their family. CNN: Is this work hard for you sometimes, on a personal level? Farley-Berens: About 80% of the parents we support are stage 4, which means that battling cancer is their full-time job. They will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives, they'll be in treatment. It's hard.  It's a rollercoaster.  I've had bouts when a certain mom has passed where I didn't get out of bed for two weeks. And I thought, \"Why am I doing this?\"  But then I come back and remember why. And so, while Michelle is and always will be our inspiration, there are now so many others that are just as inspirational. They're why I keep doing what I do. CNN: We should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate. Farley-Berens: We're not just about moms -- we have dads, too! Not a lot, but if you are a single parent, you need the support.  They tend to even get a little special treatment.  Everybody's like, \"Oh, there's a dad here.\"  And so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them. CNN:  It's such a serious subject, but your group seems to have a very fun vibe. Farley-Berens: We're very social!  Once a month, all of our families come to pick up their supplies.  We do crafts with the kids, snacks and have a good time.  We like having any event because cancer sucks, and there's not a lot of happy that goes with that. But life does still go on, so it's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun. No one can understand what they're going through like another single parent with cancer. So giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful. Cancer can be so defeating.  It's an ugly word and it's a sad word.  And so, it's my hope that Singleton Moms can bring joy and say to cancer, \"You can't defeat us.  We are still going to be strong and we're going to celebrate life.  And you can't take that away from us.\" Want to get involved?

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "An Arizona police chief on Wednesday supported an officer's decision to drive his car into an armed suspect, saying that although the move could have killed the suspect, deadly force was justified. Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

On February 19, officer Michael Rapiejko hit the suspect, Mario Valencia, with his car after Valencia refused to drop his rifle and pointed it at the officer. Valencia survived and was hospitalized before being charged with 15 crimes. Rozema stated that if Rapiejko hadn't acted, Valencia might have hurt someone else. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, called the action excessive force. The incident has sparked debate over the appropriate use of force in such situations. Valencia has a prior record and is facing numerous charges. No charges have been filed against the officer. Valencia's next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about \"expanding the Republican Party\" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.\n", "chosen": "Amy McGrath, the first woman and person of color to serve in the Kentucky State Senate, criticizes Senator Rand Paul's presidential campaign announcement.

There is a third path. We can cooperate with the world.\" Rouhani said his government kept its word to Iranians when negotiating the framework deal, which was agreed upon Thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. Chief among them is that Iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions. He thanked Iranians for their patience and for \"resisting\" by standing up for the country's rights. As to the rest of the world, the Iranian President said he thinks most now realize that Iran \"is pursuing peaceful objectives.\" That means trying to develop nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, as many feared. That fear, combined with distrust of Iran's leaders, spurred the sanctions and the Middle Eastern nation's isolation. \"We do not lie,\" Rouhani said, vowing that Iran will be true to its word, \"provided the other parties will implement their own promises.\" What Iranians think of the deal. Those promises include reducing Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98% for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges. Still, while it will be shrunken and centralized, Iran's nuclear program won't go away. What should happen -- assuming there's a common view that Tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions. That was non-negotiable for Iran, with Rouhani saying the deal shows his government's commitment to removing a major \"obstacle ... for business\" by addressing the world's worries about its nuclear program. \"We need economic productivity, employment for the youth and development of non-oil products,\" he said. \"Thus our people can witness better things for their welfare.\" It won't be easy, of course, to get Iran and the P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement, if there is one. After all, it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal. What's in the deal? 7 key points. That agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony, particularly between Iran and the United States. Those tensions haven't disappeared, nor is there any guarantee that talks won't fall apart again over the next three months. Even as he applauded what he called a \"good deal,\" President Barack Obama pointed out Thursday that \"if Iran cheats, the world will know it.\" His government is also being pressed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who blasted the agreement Friday as posing a \"grave danger\" by legitimizing Iran's nuclear program and making it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. On the Iranian side, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has acknowledged that \"mutual mistrust\" has long plagued talks. He notes Iran still has \"serious differences with the United States,\" even after Thursday's agreement. Still, Rouhani expressed hopes Friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up Iran to the rest of world, including long-standing adversaries. \"We do shake hands with them. ... Even those countries we have tensions with, we would like an end to the animosity,\" he said. \"Cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone.\" Netanyahu: Iran must recognize Israel's right to exist.\n", "chosen": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the proposed international deal on his country's nuclear program, promising that Iran will adhere to its commitments.

Gipson (D-Carson) says the issue was brought to his attention through tragic circumstances.\n“In 2020, Angelo Quinto, a Filipino-American Navy Veteran dealing with a mental health crisis, stopped breathing while two police officers knelt on his back and neck. Mr. Quinto’s official cause of death was determined to be excited delirium,” said Gipson.\nGipson says neither the American Medical Association (AMA) nor the American Psychiatric Association recognizes this term as a legitimate diagnosis.\n“In fact, the only place where this term is continuously used is to describe deaths that occur in police custody,” said Gipson.\nAmerican Medical Association opposes the diagnosis\nIn 2021, AMA adopted a policy that opposed “excited delirium” as a medical diagnosis.\n“The new policy addresses reports that show a pattern of using the term “excited delirium” and pharmacological interventions such as ketamine as justification for excessive police force, disproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody,” said the 2021 AMA news release.\nPolice may use ketamine – a sedative, to calm citizens with “excited delirium.” The use of a taser and physical restraint may also be used in addition to the sedative.\nAMA says they recognize the risk that sedative/hypnotic and dissociative drugs have in relation to an individual’s age, underlying medical conditions, and potential drug interactions when used outside of a hospital setting by a non-physician.\nRELATED: New bill would ban mandatory evictions for tenants accused of a crime\nSolution for handling medical emergencies\nThe Brookings Institution says medically-trained professionals should be the primary responders and decision-makers in the management of medical emergencies, such as drug intoxication or psychosis.\n“In scenarios where police involvement is unavoidable, de-escalation strategies should be employed – officers currently only have about 8 hours of training in crisis intervention and de-escalation techniques, compared to about 100 hours of training on firearms and defensive tactics,” says the report.\nThey go on to say that the use of firearms or violent restraints, such as chokeholds restricting blood flow to the brain, are never appropriate medical interventions.

The interior was definitely upgraded as the booths give it a more restaurant ambiance.  The bathrooms were nicely done and very clean.\n\nWe sat in the front patio overlooking Carpinteria Blvd and took our first look at the new menus.

Our plates arrived and we just looked at each other as the rice was in clumps.  Literally.  The rice and beans were cold to the touch and when we cut into the chicken it was RAW.   Dark pink RAW.  We called over the server and she apologized and took it back.  The same plates were returned with the same pieces of chicken grilled to a near burnt crisp (chefs revenge I'm guessing) and the rice and beans were still cold.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Washington (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight. Roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry. The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century, and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race. Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage, but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation's highest court, led by Roberts. Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. He dissented in United States v. Windsor, a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. And he's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans. Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice, and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally. They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again. \"If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality, the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court,\" said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is advocating for same-sex marriage. \"Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision?\" For some conservatives, a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment. It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter, who was nominated to the bench by George H.W. Bush and who retired in 2009, consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty. Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government's taxing authority. The hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people, not the courts. \"The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution,\" said Edward Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice.\" Those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case. In his majority opinion, Kennedy said the \"principal purpose\" of the Defense of Marriage Act was to \"impose inequality.\" Roberts disagreed. He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide \"uniformity and stability\" at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman. Roberts picked up on Kennedy's language that emphasized the states' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday \"come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions.\" David Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case. \"Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage,\" Cruz said. Indeed, the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage. Another clue to Roberts' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton, who signed it into law. \"I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry,\" Roberts wrote. The comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people. But backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own. Schaeffer points out that Roberts didn't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage don't violate the Constitution. \"Roberts didn't join them in expressing those views,\" Schaeffer said. At the time, Roberts simply wrote that the court \"does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does not decide\" whether states can ban same-sex marriage. Schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasn't before the court. \"But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality,\" she said. The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage. The case concerned a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage. But Roberts, writing for the majority, dismissed the case, holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court. The ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California. Roberts' lesbian cousin, who lives in California, sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case. Few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court, but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans. On the first day of the term last fall, the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue. Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases. But conventional wisdom was completely wrong. Without comment, the court declined to take up any of the cases, clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages. The court's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known. But some speculate on one possible scenario: Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor. Then again, even if the speculation were true, it doesn't reveal much about Roberts' thinking. There's a big difference between voting not to take up a case, which expresses no opinions on the merits, and issuing an opinion on the merits. And even when Roberts' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide, his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking. \"When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say, 'Let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals,' \" Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments. \"The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples.\"\n", "chosen": "Chief Justice John Roberts is expected to play a crucial role in the upcoming US Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry.

However, Roberts also made comments suggesting that he might be open to considering same-sex marriage bans. Both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage are closely watching Roberts' actions and words, hoping to gain insight into his ultimate decision. Some believe that Roberts may surprise conservatives by voting in favor of same-sex marriage, while others think he will stick to his conservative roots and uphold the state bans. The outcome of the case is highly uncertain, and many are waiting anxiously to see how Roberts will ultimately rule.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury. The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe.

The release of video from one of the officer's body cameras put the shooting back in the headlines last month.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. \"Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,\" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. \"We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.\" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: \"Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism.\" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. \"Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,\" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a \"strategic mistake\" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, \"Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen.\" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, \"In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist.\" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.\n", "chosen": "Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have escalated due to their involvement in the Yemen conflict. Both countries accuse each other of meddling in the region and backing opposing factions. The situation has become more volatile since Saudi Arabia launched Operation Decisive Storm, which aims to repel Iranian influence in Yemen. Despite efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and a political solution, the conflict remains unresolved. Iran has proposed a four-point plan, which includes a ceasefire, humanitarian aid, political dialogue, and the formation of an inclusive government. However, the plan has been rejected by Saudi Arabia, and the situation remains precarious. Both countries face difficult choices, with Riyadh considering a full-scale invasion of Yemen and Tehran facing the risk of fueling sectarian tensions in the region. A political compromise appears to be the only viable solution.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}
{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in China's northwestern Xinjiang region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.\n", "chosen": "In China, 7,000 people gathered in a stadium to witness the public mass sentencing of 55 prisoners, including three who received the death penalty. This event was part of China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang. The article highlights how governments worldwide are misusing the death penalty to combat crime and terrorism. In Pakistan, over 60 people have been executed since lifting a six-year moratorium, while Iran and Iraq used the death penalty for alleged terrorist activities. Other countries, such as Jordan and Indonesia, also carried out executions. The article concludes that the death penalty is ineffective in deterring crime and that governments should abolish it. According to Amnesty International, the number of executions globally decreased in 2014, but the organization continues to campaign for an end to the death penalty. Currently, 140 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

After deliberating for 11½ hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial.

The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges. Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four.

Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot.

The main problem with this place is that they aren't reliably open when they say they will be.\n\nI've been here three or four times now.  They have a lineup of seemingly ordinary taco styles like carnitas, barbacoa, and al pastor, but the execution is anything but ordinary.  The al pastor and barbacoa are unusually succulent and delicious.  On top of these, they have fish tacos that set a high bar for other taquerias to meet.  They also set a high bar for your wallet to meet, though: their signature \"mango pescado\" taco will set you back $6.  (Admittedly, it's a bit larger than an ordinary taco, and according to the guy they use locally-caught fish, which is cool.)  The salsa lineup doesn't disappoint either.\n\nThe place is tiny, so seating is ultra-minimal: a small counter inside and two tiny tables just outside the door.  You eat off plates displaying the likeness of Jesus Christ, the virgin Mary, or the like.  Cash only.\n\nThis would be a go-to place in my taco rotation but for one fatal flaw: they don't keep reliable hours.  A sign on the door purports to show the hours that they're open, but they don't keep to that schedule.  I came by with a friend at about 8:05pm one night.  The sign said they were open until 9pm that night, but the place was totally closed --- not like just cleaning up, but totally dark and clearly had closed up much earlier.  Another time, when it was open, I asked the guy behind the counter what their hours were, and he couldn't give a straight answer either,.  Yet another time, while waiting for my tacos, I saw an employee of SBMenus (a local restaurant delivery service) come in and tell the Tacos El Rey employee that SBMenus has had to cancel delivery orders because the place wasn't open.  I've also popped by now and then when walking around downtown, only to find it closed probably about half the time.\n\nTo me, not being open when you say you'll be is a major transgression; I considered knocking them down to three stars but decided to be kind and stick with 4.  It's also doubly peculiar because the location is half a block off of lower State, a stone's throw from various bars and tons of tourist foot traffic.  These guys could be making money hand over fist if they opened reliably.  (I imagine they could make an absolute killing if they opened for late-night, like the former pita place in this location did.)\n\nThere's no question that the tacos are excellent, but I fear for the future of Tacos El Rey if they can't maintain consistent opening hours.

The meeting in a small conference room on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas came as the two countries work to end the Cold War enmity that had led to a total freeze of diplomatic ties. And while both leaders proclaimed progress had been made, a key stumbling block -- Cuba's place on the U.S. list of countries that sponsor terror -- remained unresolved. \"This is obviously an historic meeting,\" Obama said at the beginning of his session with Castro, claiming that decades of strain had done little to benefit either Cubans or citizens of the United States. \"It was time for us to try something new,\" he said. ‎\"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future.\" Castro, who earlier in the day said he trusted Obama, acknowledged there would be difficult stumbling blocks as his nation works to repair ties with the United States. But he said those differences could be surmounted. \"We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient,\" Castro said. \"We might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow.\" Speaking to reporters after his session with Castro, Obama said the meeting was \"candid and fruitful\" and could prove to be a \"turning point\" in his push to defrost ties with Cuba. But he said he hadn't yet decided whether to remove Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror, an outcome that had previously been expected during the summit. The State Department provided Obama with a review of the terror status this week. \"I want to make sure I have a chance to read it, study it before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be,\" Obama said. \"But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people to people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for Cuban people.\" On Friday night, Obama and Castro greeted each other courteously amid an explosion of camera flashes, shaking hands before dining at the inaugural session of the conference. The two sat at the same table but not directly next to one another. Before Obama arrived in Panama on Wednesday, he spoke with Castro by phone, laying the groundwork for what will become a new era of relations between the neighboring countries. \"The Cold War has been over for a long time,\" Obama said during opening remarks at the summit Saturday. \"I'm not interested in having battles, frankly, that began before I was born.\" That exhortation, however, seemed to be lost on Castro himself, who expanded what was meant to be a six-minute speech into a 50-minute address lecturing leaders on Cuba's revolution and giving a litany of perceived grievances to Cuba over the past 50 years. But he distinguished Obama from past American presidents, saying he respected Obama's move toward reconciliation. \"In my opinion, President Obama in an honest man,\" Castro said through an interpreter. \"I admire him, and I think his behavior has a lot to do with his humble background.\" A U.S. administration official said Castro's long list of grievances was expected, despite the move toward diplomatic ties. \"(What's) unique and new is what he said about the president,\" the official said of Castro's praise for Obama. Obama announced in December that he was seeking to renew diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century of strife, including eventually opening embassies in Washington and Havana. Obama set to test engagement doctrine with Cuba in Panama. His meeting with Castro on Saturday isn't being billed as a formal bilateral session, but Obama's aides are still characterizing the event as the highest-level engagement with the Cuban government since then-Vice President Richard Nixon met with Fidel Castro in 1959. \"We're in new territory here,\" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday. \"The reason we're here is because the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation, focused entirely on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed.\" The overtures to Cuba have not been universally popular in the United States; some lawmakers were irate that Obama was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government. \"A recommendation to remove Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism would represent another significant misstep in a misguided policy,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat who used to the chair the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a statement last week. In Latin America, however, Obama was receiving a warm welcome after announcing he was seeking to engage Havana in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel. 9 things you wanted to ask about the Cuban embargo. He noted to applause during a session Friday that this was the first summit with Cuba in attendance. And he's cast the decision to reopen the U.S. relationship with Cuba as beneficial to the entire hemisphere, which has also embraced his immigration executive action. But even as Obama landed in Panama, the longstanding gulfs between the two countries' governments were on display. Dissidents opposed to Castro's regime were violently accosted this week by supporters of the Cuban government, a scuffle the White House said was unacceptable. \"As we move toward the process of normalization, we'll have our differences, government to government, with Cuba on many issues -- just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies,\" Obama said at a meeting of civil society leaders Friday. \"There's nothing wrong with that.\" \"But I'm here to say that when we do speak out, we're going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values,\" he said. The long history between the U.S. and Cuba. Obama closed out his time in Panama with a news conference where he covered topics ranging from Hillary Clinton's expected presidential announcement to his framework deal with Iran on its nuclear program. The President had pointed criticism for Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. Earlier this week, McCain accused Secretary of State John Kerry of intentionally mischaracterizing what the sides had agreed to in the Iran nuclear deal. \"John Kerry is delusional,\" McCain said on the Hugh Hewitt show, a conservative talk radio program, adding that the view from the Supreme Leader of Iran of the provisions agreed to \"is probably right,\" rather than what the United States maintains are the agreed provisions. While discussing the Iran agreement Saturday, Obama brought up those remarks without being asked. \"When I hear someone like Sen. McCain recently suggest that our secretary of state, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, (is) a Vietnam veteran, who's provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy of the interpretation of what's in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran, that's an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries,\" he said at the news conference. After the President's remarks, McCain tweeted \"So Pres. Obama goes to #Panama, meets with Castro and attacks me - I'm sure Raul is pleased.\" As for his 2008 Democratic rival, Obama said, \"If she decides to run, if she makes an announcement, she's going to have some strong messages to deliver,\" he said.\n", "chosen": "President Barack Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time in over 50 years.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "The cover-up is often worse than the crime. Henry Louis Gates stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his PBS documentary series \"Finding Your Roots\" because the actor Ben Affleck put pressure on him. Affleck's concern was that the segment would have aired his family's dirty laundry, which includes a slaveholding ancestor, Benjamin Cole. Affleck said, in a statement posted on Facebook, that he \"didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed.\" And Gates later explained that he subbed that part of the segment for another that made for more \"compelling television.\" But providing a window into the importance of slavery's past to America's present should never just be about what makes for good television. Gates missed an opportunity. And Affleck's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth (an impulse, he said on Facebook, he regrets) is surprising. Last month, Affleck lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the Democratic Republic of Congo by testifying before Congress. He isn't shy about aligning himself with causes and issues. What more could he do if his instinct is also to tackle issues closer to home: the legacy of slavery in his own family tree and how it is possible -- necessary -- to reject the racism passed through generations even today. He should have shown the courage to stay in an uncomfortable place. What a teachable moment for the country. In any case, why did he agree to do a television show if he was concerned about what might be discovered? He could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry, if privacy was what he wanted. The irony here is that none of this would have ever been found out if Sony's emails had not been hacked and if Gates hadn't written to Michael Lynton, CEO of Sony Entertainment, for advice. In the leaked exchange, Lynton advised: \"I would take it out if no one knows, but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky.\" Gates acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest \"would be a violation of PBS rules.\" Then he does it anyway. Gates, however, denies doing this. After the story came to light, he released a statement saying that he \"maintained editorial control\" and decided what made \"for the most compelling program.\" For Affleck's \"Finding Your Roots\" segment, he substituted a Revolutionary War ancestor instead of the slave-owning one. If Gates thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it didn't make for good television, there would have been no need to consult with Lynton; Gates could have given Affleck what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong Affleck's story was. The original script, reprinted on Gawker and elsewhere, makes it clear, however, that the slave-owner angle makes for better television. Here are some excerpts:. Gates sets up the segment describing Benjamin Cole as living in Savannah, Georgia. Affleck responds that he has a house in Savannah. Gates says \"Really?\" and asks whether he knew he had roots there. Affleck says he had no idea he had any Southern roots at all. Then the voice-over lowers the boom: \"We wanted to see if we could learn how Ben's ancestor felt about (slavery).\" Gates shows the slave schedule of the 1850 Census to Affleck, who says, \"There's Benjamin Cole, owned 25 slaves.\" Affleck says, \"It gives me a kind of sagging feeling to see, uh, a biological relationship to that. But you know, there it is, part of our history.\" Gates then says: \"But consider the irony, in your family line. Your mom went back fighting for the rights of black people in Mississippi, 100 years later. That's amazing.\" Affleck then observes: \"Indeed, people like my mother and many others who have made a much better America than the one that they were handed.\" What a great line. What a great story. And indeed when a public figure -- a celebrity -- chooses to confront the past like this, instead of ignoring it, he can provide a powerful example to a country that struggles daily with the roots of racism in its present. This is the kind of enlightened approach Gates and PBS should have been interested in facilitating. White Americans' lack of comfort in talking about slavery, race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president, we are still, as a country, far from post-racial. Affleck's segment had the potential to continue an important dialogue -- but the brand management part of Affleck won, and the rest is history. The fallout continues. Gates has to deal with PBS and WNET's internal review. He should not walk away without consequences. If you're going to run with the megastars, you need to have mega-ethics.\n", "chosen": "Ben Affleck appeared on PBS documentary series \"Finding Your Roots\" hosted by Henry Louis Gates. During the episode, Gates planned to reveal that Affleck's ancestor, Benjamin Cole, was a slave owner. However, Affleck asked Gates to remove the segment due to concerns about airing his family's \"dirty laundry\". Gates initially agreed but later claimed that he decided to substitute the segment with another one. The controversy arose after Sony's email hack revealed the conversation between Gates and Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, who advised Gates to keep the segment if nobody knew about it. Gates denied deleting the segment, claiming he maintained editorial control. Critics argue that Gates' decision to hide the slavery aspect of Affleck's family history perpetuates white discomfort with discussing racism. The incident highlights the importance of confronting the past and promoting honest discussions about racism. Gates faces an internal review at PBS and WNET, and critics call for consequences for his actions. Affleck's reluctance to discuss his family's connection to slavery despite being open about other social issues is seen as surprising and disappointing.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Catania, Italy (CNN)The boat that sank in the Mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid, a U.N. official said. Carlotta Asami, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency, made the comments to CNN early Tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in Catania, Italy. \"They say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that, you know, a big ship creating a big wave -- they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance,\" Asami said. The account she offered differs from that provided by Italian authorities on Sunday. They said that as the cargo ship King Jacob approached late Saturday, migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side, hoping to be saved, and caused the vessel to capsize. Mark Clark -- a communications executive representing OSM Maritime Group, the company that manages the King Jacob -- denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize. He said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side, causing many to fall off. The cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached, hardly making any waves, Clark told CNN. It deployed rescue boats, a gangway, nets and life rings, he said. The conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the Mediterranean. Asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were \"consistent\" in what they were saying. She said their accounts made it \"credible to think\" that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya. Previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950. Italian authorities, who have been coordinating the rescue effort, say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered. The King Jacob, whose crew members are all from the Philippines, saved 22 of the survivors, according to Clark. The cause of the shipwreck is part of Italian authorities' investigation, said Giovanni Salvi, Catania's public prosecutor. Investigators want to study the King Jacob's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat, he told a news conference Monday. The likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa. Many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat. Asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat, while many people were down in the lowest area. Italian authorities said Sunday that an unidentified Bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel. Two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in Sicily on Monday, according to Italian police officer Maria Guia Federico. They were the boat's Tunisian captain and a Syrian crew member, said Salvi, the Catania prosecutor. Italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to Catania, Salvi said, according to Italian media. The sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the Mediterranean to which European governments are struggling to respond. Vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the Mediterranean to southern Europe for years, but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue. The number of deaths has also skyrocketed. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between Libya and Italy just in the past week. It reported Monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters. Shipping companies recently warned that European governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble. \"We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues, with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time,\" the European Community Shipowners Associations said in a letter to EU leaders last month. \"Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues, which also create serious risks to the safety, health and welfare of ships' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations,\" the letter said. Commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the Mediterranean last year, according to the International Organization for Migration. That's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the Italian Coast Guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the Italian Navy, which was running a special program, Mare Nostrum, for most of the year. European Union ministers met Monday in Luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis. \"We are not yet working on numbers, but what we have agreed on today is, for sure, the need to increase significantly the resources at sea, and the level of the operation, doing more search and rescue and doing it more together,\" said Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security police. Mogherini told CNN that the European Union must fight human traffickers, strengthen Europeans' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees. \"We need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people, so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions,\" Mogherini said. \"My pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died.\" But some groups said European officials were offering too little too late. \"What we needed from EU foreign ministers today was life-saving action, but they dithered,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save The Children. \"With each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and Europe slips further into an immoral abyss,\" Forsyth said in a statement. \"Right now, people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Catania, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

Toprol can be taken once a day and Lopressor is usually taken at least twice a day.\n\npassage 2:Tartrate vs Succinate. The key difference between tartrate and succinate is that succinate is derived from the succinic acid and tartrate is derived from the tartaric acid. These two chemical substances are widely used in the beverage industry and drug manufacturing.Succinic acid is ethan-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Succinate form of metoprolol is an extended release drug and it plays its role in the circulatory system for 24 hours. However, the tartrate form of metoprolol does not appear in the blood stream for 24 hours because metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release drug.\n\npassage 3:Release time. The primary difference between metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate is the length of time that the drugs stay in your bloodstream. Metoprolol succinate will stay in a person's bloodstream for 24 complete hours. This means that the medication is a once per day pill.Metoprolol tartrate, on the other hand, will not stay in the bloodstream as long and thus needs to be taken at regular intervals.etoprolol succinate has a greater dehydrating effect. Thus, the side effects constipation and dry mouth are primarily associated with this version of the medication. Conversely, metoprolol tartrate may cause diarrhea. It also has the potential to cause sleep issues such as insomnia or unusual dreams.\n\n", "chosen": "The main difference between tartrate and succinate is that succinate is derived from succinic acid while tartrate is derived from tartaric acid.

That small boast on social media can trigger a whirlwind that spins into real-life grief, as a Texas veterinarian found out after shooting a cat. Dr. Kristen Lindsey allegedly shot an arrow into the back of an orange tabby's head and posted a proud photo this week on Facebook of herself smiling, as she dangled its limp body by the arrow's shaft. Lindsey added a comment, CNN affiliate KBTX reported. \"My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head! Vet of the year award ... Gladly accepted.\" Callers rang the phones hot at Washington County's Animal Clinic, where Lindsey worked, to vent their outrage. Web traffic crashed its website. High price of public shaming on the Internet. Then an animal rescuer said that Lindsey's prey was probably not a feral cat but the pet of an elderly couple, who called him \"Tiger.\" He had gone missing on Wednesday, the same day that Lindsey posted the photo of the slain cat. CNN has not been able to confirm the claim. As the firestorm grew, Lindsey wrote in the comments underneath her post: \"no I did not lose my job. Lol. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome!\" That prediction was wrong. The clinic fired Lindsey, covered her name on its marquee with duct tape, and publicly distanced itself from her actions. \"Our goal now is to go on and try to fix our black eye and hope that people are reasonable and understand that those actions don't anyway portray what we're for here at Washington Animal Clinic,\" said Dr. Bruce Buenger. \"We put our heart and soul into this place.\" The clinic told WBTX that Lindsey was not available for comment. CNN is reaching out to her. She removed her controversial post then eventually shut down her Facebook page. Callers also complained to the Brenham Police Department and Washington County Animal Control, as her Facebook post went viral. The sheriff's office in Austin County, where the cat was apparently shot, is investigating, and Lindsey could face charges. Its dispatchers were overloaded with calls, the sheriff posted on Facebook. \"We are asking you to please take it easy on our dispatchers. As soon as the investigation is complete, we will post the relevant information here on this page,\" the post read. Animal rights activists are pushing for charges. \"Animal cruelty must be taken seriously, and the guilty parties should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\" said cat advocacy activist Becky Robinson. Her organization, Alley Cat Allies, is offering a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot the cat. But others stood up for Lindsey. \"She's amazing.

This year, Israel's Memorial Day commemoration is for bereaved family members such as Braham. \"Now I truly understand everyone who has lost a loved one,\" Braham said. Her husband, Philippe Braham, was one of 17 people killed in January's terror attacks in Paris. He was in a kosher supermarket when a gunman stormed in, killing four people, all of them Jewish. The terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, recorded the attack on camera. Philippe Braham was laid to rest in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul cemetery after the attacks, not far from where the Jewish Agency held a memorial ceremony to mourn victims of terror. \"Today we all share the same pain,\" Valerie Braham said to the assembled crowd. \"I know they protect us from above.\" As Israel mourns on the nation's remembrance day, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced after his weekly Cabinet meeting that French authorities had foiled a terror plot. Valls said that France is fully mobilized following January's attack, which allowed authorities to identify and stop the planned attack. The latest news is a painful reminder of Braham's recent loss. Braham now lives for her young children. She has two daughters and one son. Braham tells them stories of their father to keep his memory alive and to keep herself strong. She pauses as she speaks, finding the right words to describe the love of her life who was taken from her. \"We had 10 years of marriage together, and we were a perfect couple. We had no problems. We didn't fight. It was like the day we were married,\" she said, holding back tears. She has told this story before, but it doesn't seem to get any easier. One month after the terror attacks in Paris, a gunman attacked a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, killing Dan Uzan, who was working as a security guard for a bat mitzvah party. Uzan, 37, was laid to rest in Copenhagen. Like Valerie Braham, Uzan's parents attended the memorial service in Jerusalem. The recent attacks were on the nation's collective mind as mourners gathered in groups to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of terror. The Copenhagen attack forced Braham to relive her fear. \"I have no idea,\" she said, hesitating. \"It seems they found a way to attack outside of war. It seems easy for them to attack, and it's frightening.\" When asked where she feels at home, Braham doesn't hesitate. It is her most confident answer. \"In Israel. Obviously, in Israel. In God's name, we will move to Israel.\" Braham said she will move her family from Paris to Israel when she is ready, but she does not want to feel like she is running away.\n", "chosen": "Valerie Braham, whose husband Philippe was killed in a January terror attack in Paris, attended an Israeli Memorial Day ceremony in Jerusalem with other families who lost loved ones to terrorism.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Is America a nation divided?  And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s.  Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries:. • Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. • Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. • Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. • Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will,\" she said.\n", "chosen": "Jennifer Stewart, an American, reported that Etihad Airways lost her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix, after a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York City.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. \"That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,\" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. \"I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,\" attorney Mary Koch said this week, \"I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents \"an inflection point,\" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a \"continuation in a process toward justice.\" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a \"duty to protect the justice process.\" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to \"seek justice for optics\" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: \"Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end.\" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. \"We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,\" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI \"will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks.\" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess \"policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens.\" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. \"Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,\" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. \"We welcome outside review,\" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. \"We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened.\" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he \"fled unprovoked.\" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. \"We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,\" he said. \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a \"rough ride\" or \"nickel ride,\" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is \"potential\" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. \"That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,\" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again \"to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. \"It's complex,\" Davis said of the probe. \"It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.\n", "chosen": "Baltimore investigators handed over their files on Freddie Gray's death to prosecutors, but the public shouldn't expect charges soon. The process will continue, and the task force investigating Gray's death will keep gathering evidence.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Several of the world's worst terrorist groups, like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, aim to create societies governed by strict, distorted versions of Sharia law. That means anyone who doesn't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- Christians included. Of course, Christians aren't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations. For example, most victims of ISIS are fellow Muslims who refuse to go along with the ISIS worldview and ruthless tactics. Still, there's ample evidence that Christians have been targeted. The latest came Friday, when an Italian prosecutor revealed that a network of Pakistanis associated with al Qaeda talked about attacking the Vatican back in March 2010. \"This is ... a reminder about the world we're in right now,\" U.S. Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland, told CNN on Friday. \"...I do think there's a larger narrative about Christian persecution (by) militant groups around the world.\" This attack wasn't carried out, but many others have been. Some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific, such as reports that Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. Other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups, including these recent examples:. Sid Ahmed Ghlam asked for an ambulance to come to his Paris home on Sunday after (he claimed) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh. Besides getting medical help, Ghlam was arrested after authorities found four Kalashnikov guns, a revolver, ammunition, police armbands and more in his car and residence, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said on Wednesday. They also turned up \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS\" and correspondence with someone in Syria \"asking him to target a church.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls later went to a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif, one of the at least two such Christian places of worship that Ghlam allegedly targeted. While he didn't elaborate, Molins said that the satellite navigation system in Ghlam's car -- which included a loaded Kalashnikov and more -- had one church's location plugged in. It's not clear what group, if any, Ghlam was working with or possibly getting orders from. Still, authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32-year-old Aurelie Chatelain, whom Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since the Charlie Hebdo massacre and kosher market siege in January. Regardless of whether Ghlam is ever convicted in Chatelain's killing, it appears unlikely that he'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" French President Francois Hollande said. ISIS has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows, producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror. What set the one from April apart were the number of people killed and that they were Christians from Ethiopia. Ethiopia's government said Monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in Libya in a video released a day earlier, according to the Ethiopian News Agency. That 39-minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the Mediterranean Sea, while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away, to southern Libya. \"All praise be to Allah, the Lord and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Mohammed,\" the video's narrator says in Arabic. \"To the nation of the cross, we are back again on the sands, where the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, have stepped on before, telling you: Muslim blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap.\" The same video brazenly claims that ISIS has been merciful to Christians in Iraq -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to Islam. But not all have taken this offer, according to a different speaker. \"The Islamic State has offered the Christian community this many times and set a deadline for this,\" this speaker says, using the name ISIS calls itself. \"But the Christians never cooperated.\" Everyone at Kenya's Garissa University College suffered in some way when a handful of Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the campus early this month. But death was reserved for Christians. According to AFP, the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing Muslims to leave and killing Christians. Nightmare accounts soon emerged, like that of Cynthia Cherotich, who told CNN that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates. \"(The attackers) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, ... then you lie down,\" recalled Cherotich, who refused to come out for two days. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" This tactic of separating non-Muslims from Muslims mirrors what Al-Shabaab attackers did in December at a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, where at least 36 were killed, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. One of Al-Shabaab's explicit aims is to turn Somalia, its home base, into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council of Foreign Relations. But that's not its only apparent goal, as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring Kenya, which is 80% Christian -- to inflict pain and terror. After the the Kenya university attack, which left nearly 150 people dead, Nadif Jama, Garissa's regional governor, dismissed Al-Shabaab's claims that it only kills non-Muslims as \"a tricky way of doing business.\" \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that, in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said, claiming the group's militants are \"bent on nothing but destruction. ... That is something we need to fight.\" Two suicide blasts rocked a Christian community in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more, according to officials. And that's just the beginning, pledged the Pakistani Taliban. One of the blasts left behind panicked residents, twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the Nishtar Colony of Lahore, according to video aired by CNN affiliate GEO News. Afterward, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until Sharia law is implemented in Pakistan. These blasts recalled one from September 2013, when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the All Saints of Church of Pakistan in Peshawar. Two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded, blowing themselves up, according to the Protestant diocese. Choir members and children attending Sunday school were among the dead. In a subsequent statement, the Rev. Humphrey S. Peter, the bishop of Peshawar, called the attack a \"total failure\" of official efforts to protect minorities such as Christians, who make up less than 3% of Pakistan's population. Sadly, the shock of the mass killings of the Ethiopian Christians in April may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before. ISIS released a five-minute video in February showing the mass murder of Coptic Christians from Egypt. Produced by the Islamic State's propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, the video shows black-clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a Libyan beach. Some of the hostages cry out \"Oh God\" and \"Oh Jesus\" as they are pushed to the ground, just before they take their final breaths. \"The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood,\" a masked man says in English before the beheadings. News of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 Egyptian Christians were kidnapped in two incidents in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. The ISIS video shows the beheading of around a dozen men, though Egyptian officials say all 21 kidnapped Christians were killed. Egypt's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in ISIS' Libyan stronghold of Derna, according to Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. \"Avenging Egyptian blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty,\" the Egyptian military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television. Modern-day Assyrians are a significant part of human history, tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations. Their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace Christianity in large numbers. Now the Assyrians are battling ISIS for survival in their native Syria and Iraq. This fight came into focus in February, when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 Assyrians hostage in northeastern Syria, according to Osama Edward, the founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Edward expressed fears then that these Assyrians in Syria would meet the same fate as others in neighboring Iraq. Some of the Assyrian hostages taken in February have been released, but the fate of many more remains unknown. Even those not in captivity face dire threats, given ISIS's well-established reputation of offering little to no mercy to Christians. The number of Christians in Iraq has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today, according to estimates from CAPNI, the largest Christian relief organization in northern Iraq. ISIS isn't the only reason for this drop, but it certainly is a big one. The militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in Iraq as well as Syria, with Christians among its targets. That includes its taking over Iraq's largest Christian city, the mostly Assyrian community of Qaraqosh, in August 2014. ISIS has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond Qaraqosh, though, like its capture and control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. The group's advance there prompted Christian families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to Islam, paying a fine or facing \"death by sword.\" Mark Arabo, a Chaldean-American leader and spokesman for the group Ending Genocide in Iraq, claims that Iraqi Christian children have been beheaded, mothers raped and fathers killed by ISIS militants in recent months. \"This is truly a living nightmare that's not going away,\" Arabo told CNN. \"Christianity in Mosul is dead, and a Christian holocaust is in our midst.\"\n", "chosen": "ISIS and Al-Shabaab, among other terrorist groups, aim to establish societies governed by distorted versions of Sharia law.

Additionally, ISIS has produced propaganda videos showing the beheading of Christians, including 30 Ethiopians, and Al-Shabaab has separately attacked a university in Kenya, targeting Christians. In Pakistan, the Pakistani Taliban has vowed to continue attacking Christians until Sharia law is implemented.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Debates on climate change can break down fairly fast. There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said.  \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. \"Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,\" the agency warns. \"Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.\" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. \"Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,\" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. \"Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,\" the article says. \"This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough.\" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. \"When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,\" Obama said. \"The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog.\" \"We know how to do this,\" Obama said. \"We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.\"\n", "chosen": "President Barack Obama discussed the link between climate change and public health during a roundtable discussion at Howard University's College of Medicine. He emphasized the importance of addressing climate change to protect vulnerable Americans, citing his experience growing up in Los Angeles where air quality was poor before regulations improved it. The discussion highlighted the impact of climate change on health, including increased asthma attacks, and the need for action to mitigate its effects. Obama mentioned that companies like Google and Microsoft are working on apps to help track air quality and plan for prevention. The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause 250,000 additional deaths annually by 2050 due to factors such as malaria, heat exposure, and under-nutrition.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Washington (CNN)Early Clinton campaign calculations, the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns, a GOP ticket for the generations, and Republican calendar concerns filled our Sunday trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. 1. Watch the volume as O'Malley uses YouTube to test Clinton pokes. Slowly but clearly, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. How aggressive will he get? Stay tuned -- literally. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says O'Malley enjoys using YouTube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by Clinton, like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver's licenses. \"Every time Hillary Clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers' licenses that we discussed and other things -- Martin O'Malley has been releasing a YouTube video showing a speech where he has done something different, so watch for that to continue,\" said Zeleny. \"Those YouTube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race --the liberals love them.\" 2. The \"Obama Factor\": Clinton finds a lot to love, and some distance. Hillary Clinton is a big fan of President Obama's health care law, but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style. So reports AP's Lisa Lerer, who was in Iowa this past week for the Clinton campaign rollout, and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime Obama 2008 rival who, of course, went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state. \"She embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law, for his push for immigration legislation -- but it wasn't all sunshine and light,\" said Lerer. \"She also took subtle digs at his leadership style— she said America was on the wrong track-- I can't believe I'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a Republican.\" 3. In big policy choice, Clinton signals an important campaign focus. In Democratic politics, Kamala is the Harris sister who gets the most national buzz. But Maya Harris is about to play a big role in the question of how Hillary Clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes. Kamala Harris is the California attorney general and a 2016 Senate candidate, for the seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Boxer. Maya Harris just signed on for a top policy role in the Clinton campaign -- and CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message. \"One clue, I think, is Maya Harris,\" said Henderson. \"Her resume is really a liberal's dream.  She has worked at the Center for American Progress, ACLU, she's also done work on community policing and police reforming, and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate.\" \"So I think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that Hillary Clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color, who are so crucial to getting the Obama coalition back together again.\" 4. Walker-Rubio? Rubio-Walker? A general contrast with some GOP buzz. Marco Rubio drew a direct generational contrast with Hillary Clinton when he officially joined the GOP 2106 race, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also often talks of his hope Republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee. In political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a Walker-Rubio pairing is not limited to inside the Beltway chatter. \"They both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that Clinton and Gore did ... in 1992,\" said Martin. \"But what's interesting is, in New Hampshire over the weekend, I was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates, for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- I heard somebody float the idea of a Walker-Rubio race in 2016.\" 5. Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and then? Heading into the 2016 cycle, the Republican National Committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process, including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded. Now, some big GOP establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar. Florida is usually the next big contest, but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the \"SEC primary.\" It is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress. But what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a Super Tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back Tuesdays -- in early March that include a number of conservative Southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, maybe Louisiana. The shift is one reason former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008. Ditto for Rick Santorum. They did well in the South, but it didn't matter much because John McCain and Mitt Romney, respectively, were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted. Again, there might yet be more changes. But more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like Huckabee and Cruz.\n", "chosen": "Martin O'Malley, a former Maryland governor, is intensifying his criticism of Hillary Clinton through YouTube videos.

Today, because of a CNN story and the generosity of donors from around the world, Kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing in Atlanta, where she's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow Liberians. \"It's a surprise -- a young child like me who came from a very poor background coming to the U.S.,\" she said. \"I'm thankful to CNN and I appreciate the people who made donations, and I'm thankful to Emory for accepting me to study.\" At Emory, Kekula has asked for special training on certain skills, such as caring for burns, a common type of injury because children in Liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking. One of her instructors, Kelly Fullwood, said Kekula's an excellent student who has taught her teachers a thing or two about how to do procedures without costly equipment, as she's been forced to do in Liberia. \"She fascinates me every day,\" Fullwood said. \"She gets nursing. She gets what it's about.\" Kekula, 23, was just a year away from finishing up her nursing degree in Liberia when Ebola struck and her mother, father, sister and cousin came down with the disease. Hospitals were full and no doctors would visit her home, so with just advice from a physician on the phone, Kekula took care of all four of her relatives at the same time. All but her cousin survived -- a high success rate considering that at the time, about 70% of Ebola patients were dying in Liberia. Kekula couldn't continue her nursing education in Liberia, because the schools had closed. A CNN story about Kekula in September prompted donations from around the world to IAM, an organization that raises money to help African natives pay for education. David Smith, an associate dean at Emory's nursing school, said they accepted Kekula because they were struck by how both she and Emory each treated four Ebola patients at around the same time last year -- and Emory had dozens of doctors and nurses and millions of dollars in technology while Kekula had nobody and nearly no supplies. Stop Ebola where it starts. \"It was obvious to us that this woman was intelligent and strong and fearless,\" he said.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Saturday's deadly earthquake in Nepal was the \"big one\" experts were waiting for based on the region's history. Earthquakes are a fact of life in the South Asian country, with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year, geologist and science journalist Kate Ravilious said. With the last major earthquake in 1934, the concern was not if, but when the next \"great\" earthquake would hit, said Ravilious, author of the 2014 article, \"Kathmandu's earthquake nightmare.\" In a landlocked country like Nepal, where infrastructure is fragile to begin with, the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be \"much more serious,\" Ravilious told CNN. Those fears were realized when a magnitude-7.8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of Kathmandu rocked Nepal, toppling homes, historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead, authorities said. \"This event, while large and tragic, is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from Tibet almost to Caspian Sea is an area of major collision between continental plates,\" said geological engineer Nicholas Sitar with the University of California, Berkeley's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. What's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of Kathmandu, which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes. \"The population has exploded in several decades,\" U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Gavin Hayes told CNN. \"When you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that isn't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size, that's when you see the scale of disaster we're seeing now.\" The big unknown is what happens next, now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed, Ravilious said. How will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country, whose single international airport is closed? How will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed? If and when landslides start, how will mountainside villages in the Himalayan range fare? And, will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts? \"The worry now is to get Nepal up and running again on feet,\" Ravilious said. \"The monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we don't sort things out before then.\" An earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake. Nepal is located on a major plate boundary between India and Eurasia, where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years. Those collisions are responsible for the construction of the Himalayas, which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world, said Chris Goldfinger, director of Oregon State University's Active Tectonics and Seafloor Mapping Laboratory. India is moving northward into Eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year, with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the Himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years, said Marin K. Clark, associate professor of Geological Sciences with the University of Michigan's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The last major earthquake to affect this part of the Himalayas was in the 1500s, and Kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of Saturday's quake in 1934. A major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking, Clark said. The entire area that experienced shaking was in steep, mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard. Clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. The magnitude-7.9  earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides, many of which blocked roads, slowing response and recovery efforts. The landslides also blocked river valleys, which created significant flood hazard. \"We might anticipate a similar situation for Nepal.\"\n", "chosen": "Nepal's recent earthquake was expected due to its history of seismic activity. Experts considered it a matter of when, not if, another major earthquake would occur. The country's population growth and lack of infrastructure preparedness increased concerns. The earthquake, measuring 7.8 magnitude, left over 1,400 dead and caused widespread destruction. Emergency response teams face challenges in reaching the affected areas due to road closures and the risk of landslides. The next steps include assessing damage, providing aid, and preparing for the upcoming monsoon season. Experts warn of the possibility of further landslides and flooding.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "We did it again, in another American city. We set Baltimore on fire this time. We brutalized black bodies. We turned a funeral into a riot. We let things get out of hand. We looted. We threw stones at policemen. We threw stones at citizens. We created camera-ready chaos, and we replayed the images. We created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response. We let the violence flow. We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like. By now you may be asking, \"Who's we?\" You may be saying with some irritation, \"Don't lump me in with them. I didn't have anything to do with it.\" To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself. The word \"we\" is one of the great American words. We the People. Yes we can. We are family. I use \"we\" a lot when I talk about our country's achievements. I like to say we won the Second World War, we put a man on the moon, we invented the Internet, we gave the world jazz. Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too. \"We\" cuts both ways. We enslaved Africans. We cut Reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship. We supported Jim Crow, then redlined, subordinated, and ghettoized African-Americans. We cut blacks out of the New Deal. We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly. We tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a War on Drugs. We failed. We are the authors of every page of Baltimore's story. Don't tell me it's not your responsibility or mine. About how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past. Someone else's problem. No, we own them all. And we all have to face that before we can fix anything in Baltimore or beyond. But there's another dimension of the story of \"we\" that matters as well. It's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here. Every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality, the same depressing pattern breaks out. The event becomes simply a Rorschach test for left and right, and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views. For the left, it's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence. Liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame, like the surprisingly astute comments from the Baltimore Orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable. Conservatives gravitate to their own frames, about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks, about the failures of Great Society and Democratic programs, and about how it all comes back to a president (who happens to be black) who has divided us by focusing so much on race. What gets lost in this Groundhog Day replay of left-right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize: Both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week. Both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence. Both an inherited, multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it. We cannot separate out the aspects of the problem that don't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem. And until more people can see this, we will not see progress. We can't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color-caste structure and a school-to-prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse. By the same token, we can't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who, in their own small ways, are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness. I'm of the left. But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore. It cannot possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions. Whatever our political perspective, we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in Baltimore and other cities in the United States in the second decade of the 21st century. It is an abomination. We should all be able to say that. It's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "It won't come as news to anyone in America today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force.  But the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority (initial stop and question, pulling someone over for a traffic violation) becomes significant because of the potential result (deadly force). A minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants.  An initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest.  And an arrest, we know, can have fatal results. In South Carolina earlier this month, Walter Scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $18,000 in unpaid child support, according to court records. That means that once he was stopped, he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion. But failure to pay child support is not a crime. At least, not in the traditional sense, though states do criminalize it.  It's rightly a civil matter. Skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either. This means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court isn't about catching criminals -- it's bill collection, only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons, and acting under color of law.  This raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing. Not all \"warrants\" are created equal.  Sometimes there are warrants for arrest, which are issued for alleged murders, drug dealing or sexual assault. Then there are cases like the Scott case.  Bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes. Don't get me wrong.  Deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well-being today.  Forget the school-to-prison-pipeline.  Lousy parents are the prison pipeline; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads. Still, given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws, there is ultimately something Dickensian in our remedy for enforcement. First, it's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event.  Yes, parents who can't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts, but once the courts and law enforcement are involved, they do things their way.  And it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own. South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings. Oftentimes and sadly so, papa is a rolling stone, and he falls behind on his payments. When a supporting parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order. At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers. The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he's too poor to pay his child's support. If he fails to demonstrate this inability, the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him, unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments. What follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon, a game show and debtor's prison. The defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail.  If he can't, he'll be stuck in jail until he does pay.  And let's face it: While it's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads, jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to, you guessed it, earn money to pay that debt. Of course, since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant, dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates \"mixed up.\" The court's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court.  That warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant, but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a Friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on Monday. The point is this: Some warrants are for the arrest of criminals.  Those are the warrants we're familiar with, from \"Law & Order\" and every other cop show.  Other warrants, like those for contempt of a support order, have nothing to do with crime.  They're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature. Yet we've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency.  That's right, the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts.  When they run a driver's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up, those same police who are armed with Tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills. Not because he's dangerous.  Not because he's a criminal.  Because he's (breathtakingly) financially irresponsible. Walter Scott might have run because he knew the drill. He knew he was going to be arrested.  He shouldn't have run. But he also definitely shouldn't have been shot. If he owed $18,000 in arrears, he definitely shouldn't have been looking to buy a Mercedes, as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do. But whether or not he ran, the result would have been the same: If he had a bench warrant, he was going to jail, by force if necessary, even though he does not appear to have committed a \"crime.\" Of course, the counterargument is: If we don't arrest them, how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up?  There's no easy answer. But the better question may be: Why do we as a society not shun parents who don't take care of their kids?  Social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest.  Arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution, and one that could be solved with less government intrusion, and more community involvement. The Scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths. If we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads, we can't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them.  While no one should be shot for failure to pay support, we're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest. Are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force, empowered to use deadly force, to aid in collecting these bills?  If we are, then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight. And if we're comfortable with that, then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase,and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment. Then, our only defense is to watch.  And record. Note: An earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime.\n", "chosen": "In South Carolina, Walter Scott was killed during an arrest for an unpaid child support warrant. The article highlights that a minor traffic stop can lead to a check for outstanding warrants, including those for unpaid child support. The author argues that failure to pay child support is a civil matter, not a crime, and that jailing people for their debt creates a cycle of poverty. The article concludes that instead of using an armed police force to collect debts, society should focus on social rejection and community involvement to motivate parents to take care of their children.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\n", "chosen": "Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif received a hero's welcome upon his return to Iran after securing a breakthrough in nuclear talks with the US.

He was investigated by the US government over his alleged involvement with the Alavi Foundation, but no charges were filed. During the Iranian Revolution, Zarif participated in protests and later became the Iranian ambassador to the UN. He has spent more time with US Secretary of State John Kerry than any other foreign minister, working together to finalize the nuclear deal by June 30.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single. I did. And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want. \"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom,\" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. \"There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.\" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. \"I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.\" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, \"Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!\" Jackie didn't blink. \"But, Europe!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy.\" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29. Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says:  \"From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being.\" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be \"more desirable marriage prospects.\" Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt. \"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt,\" Emily Crille told me. \"That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home.\" I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable? Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right. Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: \"In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying.\" The article also points out that \"Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth.\" In an effort to understand the joys of \"sambo,\" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden. \"To put it short,\" he told us, \"marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation.\" Wow. Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, \"I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it.\" Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: \"The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities.\" My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, \"Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for.\" Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough. Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point? In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with \"I dos\"? I don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\n", "chosen": "A recent conversation with a group of journalism students revealed that they do not prioritize marriage and instead focus on personal success and happiness. One student, Candace Monacelli, stated that she worked hard for her degree and wants to be successful, and does not see the value in marrying young.

Paxton’s office and the Biden administration will present their arguments over the concertina wire on November 7.\nAccording to ABC News, Texas states border agents were \"cutting, destroying, or otherwise damaging Texas’s concertina wire that had been strategically positioned for the purpose of securing the border and stemming the flow of illegal migration.\"\nTexas states border agents cut through the wire allowing migrants to freely enter Texas.\nIn a statement, Paxton said according to CBS News:\n“By acting quickly and monitoring their actions closely, we were able to secure a restraining order, and I am confident we will continue to prevail.\"\nThe Biden administration said the wire was cut so they could provide medical aid to migrants.\nThe Department of Homeland Security added according to CBS News:\n\"[Border agents] have a responsibility under federal law to take those who have crossed onto U.S. soil without authorization into custody for processing, as well as to act when there are conditions that put our workforce or migrants at risk.\"\nHow do you think the judge will rule on this case?", "chosen": "Governor Greg Abbott received a win when a judge halted U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents from removing concertina wire along the southern border.

Brady, 73, died of pneumonia, the family said. \"Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives,\" their statement said. James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley Jr. during his attempt to assassinate Reagan in 1981. Brady spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, advocating against gun violence. He died in August. Sarah Brady was also involved in gun violence prevention for the past 30 years. She was the chairwoman of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence from 2000 until she died. The National Rifle Association said its thoughts and prayers were with the Brady family. \"Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,\" the gun rights organization said. People we've lost in 2015. On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup. Her son started to wave it around and she took it from him. It was not a toy, she said, and she fumed over what she imagined could have happened. The loaded gun was much like the one used to shoot her husband. \"It just hit me like a ton of bricks,\" she told CNN in 2013. \"So I asked Jim if he felt comfortable with me speaking out, and he said, 'Of course.'\" After that, the Bradys made it their business to be gun control activists. Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004. Read Sarah Brady's 2014 op-ed for CNN.com. Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the Brady bill in 1993, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a joint statement Saturday that the Bradys \"were fierce champions of sensible gun legislation.\" Sarah Brady \"transformed tragedy into a courageous campaign, and because of her work and her remarkable life, American families are safer today,\" the Clintons said. Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross said in a written statement that few people are responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and James Brady. \"Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend,\" he said. \"I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable.\" Sen Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who helped write the Brady bill, concurred. \"She was strong and forceful, sweet and kind, and someone I considered a friend and patriot for decades,\" he said. \"She was a true hero and will be missed by America.\" James Brady was one of four people wounded in Reagan's shooting outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the Rolling Stones' Altamont fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election. For \"Mad Men,\" the \"end of an era,\" as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been \"Mad Men\" cocktails and \"Mad Men\" museum exhibits and even \"Mad Men\" presidential references. Don Draper, the creative director played by Jon Hamm, has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a \"Mad Men\" bench was unveiled in front of New York's Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. \"The Sopranos,\" \"Mad Men\" creator Matthew Weiner's former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, \"Mad Men's\" former AMC stablemate, \"Breaking Bad,\" was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, \"Mad Men\" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the Manson murders, the Woodstock festival, a New York mayoral campaign and the Vietnam War moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the Miracle Mets. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late Lane Pryce. Of course, Weiner might have a different idea; he's from Baltimore. \"Mad Men\" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles; the \"Good War\" generation butting heads with the \"Make Love, Not War\" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state IBM world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between Sterling Cooper and former rival Cutler Gleason and Chaough. Though the agency survived, it's now without Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) and under the ownership of (real-life) Madison Avenue titan McCann Erickson. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters -- Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) and perhaps even Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) -- to look for an exit. Roger Sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by John Slattery -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand, Peggy Olson's star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence). She left Sterling Cooper once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If Olson, played by Elisabeth Moss, bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons, Don's ex-wife, Betty (January Jones), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) has been far more supportive than Don, he's a busy man. And Sally, Don's daughter (Kiernan Shipka), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock, or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970. Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.\n", "chosen": "The popular TV show Mad Men is ending after eight years. The final episodes begin on April 5th. The show is set in the 1960s and follows the lives of people working in an advertising agency. The characters are struggling with personal and professional issues as the decade comes to a close. Some characters, such as Ken Cosgrove, Harry Crane, and Joan Harris, may be leaving the agency. Others, like Peggy Olson, may be looking for a new opportunity. The show's creator, Matthew Weiner, has kept the finale a secret, but it is expected to take place shortly after the moon landing in July 1969. The show's themes include the decline of traditional values and the rise of new social norms. As the show ends, viewers are reminded of the importance of shared human experience and how individual actions affect those around them.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Think it's hard to redeem your miles for an airline award ticket? It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.\n", "chosen": "According to a Consumer Reports study, the availability of award seats varies among major US airlines. Southwest Airlines offers the most award tickets (11.9 million) and the highest percentage of award tickets (11.5%). JetBlue has the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets. The study found that award tickets are not always the best value for miles, and passengers should consider the average fare on a route before redeeming miles. Southwest Airlines has the highest customer satisfaction score, while JetBlue has the lowest. Additionally, Southwest does not charge any fees, unlike other airlines that charge for services such as bag check-in and changes.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it.

It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.\n", "chosen": "Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for the 2015 climbing season, following a deadly season last year when 16 Nepalis died in an avalanche. To reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, where the accident occurred, has been changed to a central route that takes longer but is considered safer. Climbers will now face more crevasses and use more ladders, but the change is expected to minimize the risk of avalanches. Some climbing companies, including Alpenglow Expeditions, have chosen to climb the northern route from China instead, citing increased danger on the Nepal side. The shift in routes has raised concerns about the impact on Nepal's economy, which relies heavily on tourism. Many Sherpas, who are the primary guides on the mountain, are still recovering from the trauma of last year's accident and are hesitant to return due to the risk it poses to their families. Despite these challenges, some climbers are determined to reach the summit once again, driven by a sense of adventure and a desire to overcome adversity.", "rejected": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability."}

The forecast calls for a daytime high of 80 on Friday with an overnight low of 58, then an 88 (58) on Friday. Saturday should be sunny with 88 (61) and Monday at 85 (61).", "chosen": "Sorry, this question is beyond my ability.", "rejected": "A chance of showers returns Tuesday, but this week looks pretty pleasant overall.\nThe weather will remain dry and warm over the next several days, making it perfect for outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, fishing and more.

This was after a disagreement about attending a local fair. As with many cases involving missing children, the initial assumption by law enforcement was that she ran away, especially when they found evidence suggesting she bought a bus ticket to Detroit.\nHowever, as the case developed, her stepfather, Leonard Hugall, became a significant person of interest, not least because of his documented history of child molestation and violence. Kelly's mother, Carol Hugall, deeply suspected her husband's involvement, a belief that persisted for decades.\nThe darkness of Hugall's character was further revealed when he was convicted in 1993 for horrific crimes in Florida. Only in 2006, after repeated questioning, did Hugall finally confess to the harrowing details of Kelly's last moments. He admitted to luring, kidnapping, assaulting, and finally murdering the teenager, providing chilling specifics that sent shivers down the spine of investigators.\nWhile Hugall is imprisoned for other crimes, justice for Kelly remains a challenge. Authorities have been unable to locate her remains, and Hugall's claims about where he buried her body proved unsuccessful. Despite blood evidence that somewhat corroborated his confession, the exact nature of this evidence remains ambiguous.\nFor Carol, the pain is evident. The loss of her daughter plunged her into deep despair, a feeling only amplified by the acknowledgment of Kelly at The Fallen Victims of Homicide Memorial. Kelly's details, from her appearance to her personality, serve as a testament to the vibrant young girl whose life was tragically cut short.\nThe case remains an open wound, and the call for any information related to it underscores the importance of community involvement in helping bring closure to such grievous events. Whether it's a hint about Hugall's actions or an unknown detail about Kelly's final moments, every piece of information is invaluable.\nThose with any knowledge about this heart-wrenching case should contact the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, or their local authorities, so that justice might finally be served for Kelly Harris and her grieving family.", "chosen": "Kelly Harris, a 13-year-old from Jackson, Michigan, went missing in 1984 after a disagreement with her stepfather, Leonard Hugall.

{"task_type": "Summary", "question": "Write a summary strictly based on the reference.", "reference": "Launching rockets is a complicated thing. Landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean? Well, that's never been done before. SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, hopes to give it a try. But weather forced it to scrub Monday's plan to launch. SpaceX said on Twitter that Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That will be the easy part. After the launch, SpaceX will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform, or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship, in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. The company has previously said the odds of a successful landing are about 50%. If you want to see how it goes, it will post photos online throughout the mission and will put video on YouTube. And if the landing doesn't work? SpaceX says it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\n", "chosen": "SpaceX plans to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station.
